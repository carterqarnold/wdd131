        <h2>3 Nephi 24:10</h2>
        <p>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in my house; and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of Hosts, 
            if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</p>

            <h2>Omni 1:26</h2>
            <p>And now, my beloved brethren, I would that ye should come unto Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel, and partake of his salvation, 
                and the power of his redemption. Yea, come unto him, and offer your whole souls as an offering unto him, and continue 
                in fasting and praying, and endure to the end; and as the Lord liveth ye will be saved.</p>
